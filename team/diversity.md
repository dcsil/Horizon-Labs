### Subject Matter Experts

To address our current expertise gaps, we plan to consult with a range of subject matter experts. While our team brings technical strength in software development and the perspective of students, we lack deep specialization in machine learning, the viewpoint of instructors, and the lived experiences of diverse learners. Educators such as teachers, curriculum designers, and school administrators can provide insight into challenges students and instructors face and validate whether our tools can support student learning. AI researchers and technologists can help us validate technical feasibility, highlight ethical considerations, and identify potential pitfalls we might miss as non-specialists. To address the homogeneity of our team and our limited perspective on accessibility, we also aim to work with inclusion advocates and accessibility specialists who can help us ensure challenges faced by underrepresented learners are accounted for. We plan to engage with these experts through interviews, regular check-ins and small pilot tests, beginning with local educations and researchers in our network, and expanding to a broader community to make sure our solution is both equitable and impactful.
