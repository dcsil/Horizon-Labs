This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` in an `.env.local` file if your FastAPI service is not running on `http://localhost:8000`:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Chat Persistence

- The chat experience stores the session identifier in `localStorage` (`horizon-chat-session-id`) so reloading the browser restores the same conversation.
- On load the UI calls `GET /chat/history?session_id=...` to fetch previous turns and display them before opening a new SSE stream.
- Ensure the backend is running with persistence enabled (Firestore credentials) so history requests succeed.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
